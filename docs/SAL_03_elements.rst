SAL Elements
============

There are 12 parts of speech in SAL, divided into open and closed word classes. 

Open word classes are:  nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs.  As a user you are able to add or modify open word classes (except for verbs).

Closed word classes are:  articles, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, pronouns, interrogatives, negative particles, conjunctions and punctuation.  These classes are privileged and only users with the appropriate profile can modify them.
