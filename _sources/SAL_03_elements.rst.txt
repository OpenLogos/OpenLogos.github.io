SAL Elements
============

There are 12 parts of speech in SAL, divided into open and closed word classes. 

Open word classes are:  nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs.  As a user you are able to add or modify open word classes (except for verbs).

Closed word classes are:  articles, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, pronouns, interrogatives, negative particles, conjunctions and punctuation.  These classes are privileged and only users with the appropriate profile can modify them.



SAL Taxonomy for Rulewriters and Coders

* NOUNS   -   [N]   [WC 01]    
* ADJECTIVES   -  [ADJ]  [WC 04]
* DETERMINERS  -   [DET]  [WC 14 & 15]

In these SAL Taxonomy Tables, the :navy:`navy` color denotes :navy:`Word Class`, :maroon:`maroon` denotes :maroon:`Superset`, :red:`red` denotes :red:`set`, and **black** denotes **subset** (in other contexts, :blue:`blue` is used to denote :blue:`subset`).

The SAL Taxonomy Tables provided here include word-specific codes for the closed Word Classes and also for Adverbs, but only give generic codes for Nouns, Adjectives, and Verbs.  To access word-specific codes for Nouns, Adjectives, Verbs and closed Word Classes, use the TermBuilder View Function.

Numeric Codes denote Taxonomy position (:maroon:`Superset`, :red:`set` and :blue:`subset`) by their range:  Numbers 1-16 denote :maroon:`Superset`, 17-99 denote :red:`set`, and 100-998 denote :blue:`subset`.  Note, however, that there are exceptions to this arrangement in the case of :navy:`Adverbs` (Non-Locatives), where :maroon:`Superset` codes range from 1-26 and there are no :red:`set` codes.
