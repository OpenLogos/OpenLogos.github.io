CONCRETE Count Noun Superset      [mnemonic:  CO]  [3]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:** CONCRETE Count Nouns are countable physical things, either man-made or natural, including parts of the human body.  CONCRETE Count Nouns contain both sets and subsets as shown in the frame above.

CONCRETE Nouns are always count nouns and, unless in the plural, generally cannot occur without a preceding article or quantifier. For example:   Computers are effective.  \*Computer is effective (illegal).  Note that the distinction between count nouns and MASS Nouns is critical to parsing in languages such as English.

Principal sets of CONCRETE nouns are

* functional things 
* agentive things. 

Other sets are

* natural things 
* impulses/lights
* marks/blemishes
* edibles (non-mass)
* edibles (color)
* classifiers
* amorphous
* atomistic
* undifferentiated

Functional things tend to be passive, i.e. typically do not act of their own accord and generally require an agent to use them.  Hence they are more instrumental in nature.  Agents typically do work in and of themselves.  

This distinction may sometimes seem arbitrary.  For example, hinge is a fastener under functional things and clearly does work of itself but is not coded as an agent. Airplane, on the other hand, obviously does require an agent and yet is  coded under agentives as a vehicle.  As a rule, agentives have a source of power or energy in themselves; functionals do not.

Note that parts of the human/animal body are also classified as CONCRETE.  Things like heart, brain, digestive tract, stomach, and organs in general are machines/systems under agentives.  Words like teeth, fingernail, toes, lips, tendons, ligaments, bones, etc. belong to various subsets under functionals.

**Tips:**  If a word belongs in the CONCRETE Superset but none of the sets or subsets seem to apply, use the undifferentiated set.

**Caution!**   If the noun can be used in the singular without an article or quantifier, e.g. gas, it should be coded under the MASS Superset. 

**Developers' Tip:** 

                                                           

 

 

functionals    [mnemonic: COfunc]   [code: 3 34]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:** Functionals tend to be passive, non-agentive, i.e. typically do not act of their own accord and generally require an agent to use them.  Hence they are more instrumental in nature.  By contrast, agentives typically do work in and of themselves. 

Functionals comprise the following subsets:

* devices/tools
* fasteners
* bearing surfaces
* receptacles
* conduits
* thresholds/focal points/barriers
* bridges/links
* cloth things
* structural elements
* concretizations of verbals
* concretizations of mass nouns
* undifferentiated functional things

**Tips:**  The distinction between functionals and agentives may sometimes seem arbitrary.  For example, hinge is a device under functionals and clearly does work of itself but should not be coded as an agent. Airplane, on the other hand, obviously requires an agent to operate and yet should be coded under agentives as a vehicle.  As a rule, agentives have a source of power or energy in themselves; functionals do not.

**Caution!**  Functionals are always count nouns and, unless pluralized, generally cannot occur without a preceding article or quantifier. For example: \*Brass screw is strong (illegal).  The brass screw is strong/Brass screws are strong (legal). If the word can occur in the singular without an article or quantifier, it should be coded under the MASS Superset.

 

 

 
devices/tools   [mnemonic: COtool]  [code: 3 34 720]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Devices, tools, or instruments that do not qualify as agentives.  The devices/tools subset can include anatomical parts.  In general, one can ask of devices/tools such questions as "what is it used for?"  .

**Examples:**    armature, button, claw, diode, divider, drill bit, eraser, hammer, handle, hinge, hubcap, microscope, molar, muffler, muscle, pencil, plunger, razor blade, ruler, stapler, steering wheel, thimble, valve  

**Tips:**   When preceded by the preposition with, this preposition usually has the sense of by means of.  E.g., He installed the cabinet with a screwdriver versus He installed the cabinet with a glass door.

**Caution:**   Powered devices, tools, instruments should be coded agentives.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

    

 

fasteners  [mnemonic: COfast]  [code: 3 34 721]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Any physical thing which makes fast, joins, or attaches.

**Examples:**    bolt, brad. buckle, cinch, clasp, coupling, dowel, hinge, hitch, latch, ligament, lock, lug, nail, nut, paper clip, prong, rivet, screw, skewer, snap, staple, tack, talon, tendon, tenon, yoke

**Caution:**   Words like scotch tape, masking tape, duct tape, Velcro, adhesive are not count nouns and should be coded under functional mass under the MASS Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**  

          

 

 

bearing surfaces   [mnemonic: COsurf]  [code: 3 34 722]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Any thing that functions as a support surface.

**Examples:**   bed, bench, counter, cot, couch, dais, divan, deck, desk, floor, highchair, ladder, ledge, mantel, mattress, ottoman,  pallet, platform, rack, sawhorse, scaffold, shelf, sill, stool, table, tray

**Tips:**   When used with the preposition from, this preposition has the sense off of.  E.g., She took the material from the table.

**Caution:**   Some things which might appear to be bearing surfaces fall into other categories. For example, stage should be coded functional place under PLACE Superset.  Stairs should be coded under paths in PLACE Superset. 

Exceptionally, the word saddle should be coded as a receptacle under functionals because when used with the preposition from, that preposition takes the meaning out of rather than off of.  

When used with the preposition from, some words, like bed, may cause that preposition to take on different meanings; e.g., He got up from his bed can mean either He got out of or He got off of.   The Logos system codes bed as a bearing surface as its most probable code.  E,g., He took the pillow off the bed where off has the sense off of.  

**Developers' Tips:**

     

 

 

receptacles     [mnemonic: COrecp]     [code: 3 34 659]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Containers in which something is stored, held or carried.

**Examples:**    barrel, bin, bottle, box, cabinet, carton, container, cubby hole, drum, gear housing, package, pan, pot, safe, thermos, tub, vacuum chamber, vessel

**Tips:**   When used with the preposition from, this preposition has the sense of out of.   E.g., He took the material from the box.

**Caution:**   Words such as barn, grave, pit, closet, foyer, lobby, vault should not be coded as receptacles, but as enclosed space under the PLACE Superset.  The distinction is designed to reflect the human scale and geographical connotation of PLACE nouns.

Words such as cavity, enclosure should not be coded as receptacles under CONCRETE nouns but as receptacles under ASPECTIVES.  Such words are "aspective" because they do not constitute concrete things in themselves (as in the case of enclosure) or because they are aspects of something else (as in the case of cavity).

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

conduits    [mnemonic:  COcond]    [code: 3 34 745]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Any concrete thing that serves as a channel through which fluids or energy forces may flow.

**Examples:**    airshaft, artery, bowel, capillary, catheter, duct, faucet, gaspipe, hose, nerve, nose, nozzle, pipe, pipeline, rectum, siphon, sleeve, spout, tube, vein, windpipe

**Tips:**   When used with the preposition through, this preposition has the sense of along.   E.g., Blood flows through veins.

When used with the preposition from, this preposition has the sense of out of.  E.g., Water drips from the faucet.

**Caution:**   Some conduit-type words fall into other categories.  E.g., A word like intestines should be coded as agentive.  Tubing should be coded under MASS Superset.

Words such as tunnel, trench, ravine, riverbed, canal and passage should  be coded  under the PLACE Superset.  The distinction is designed to reflect the human scale and geographical connotation of PLACE nouns.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

links/bridges    [mnemonic: COlink]    [3 34 526]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Any thing functioning as a span or passageway (non-human scale), including parts of the body

**Examples:**    circuit, ligament, ligature, overpass, ramp, span, tendon, viaduct

**Tips:**    When used with the preposition over, this preposition has a sense akin to across.   E.g., He walked over the bridge.   The signal came over the circuit.

**Caution:**   Words like chain, network belong in the ASPECTIVE Superset.   A word like circuitry is a MASS Noun 

**Developers' Tips:**    Despite the human scale of words like bridge, viaduct, ramp, these words should be coded here rather than in the PLACE Superset.

 

 

 

 

thresholds/focal points/barriers  [mnemonic: CObarr]    [3 34 525]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    This is a catch-all subset for things which serve as spatial limits, boundaries and barriers; or serve as focal points, or as thresholds.

**Examples of Focal Points and Thresholds:**    archway, door, entranceway,   faucet, gate, hatch, intake, port (hardware sense), screen door, seacock, seam, spigot, threshold, turnstile, window

**Examples of Barriers and Boundaries:**   backstop, baffle, bulkhead, ceiling, dike, fence, floodgate, folding screen, pale and paling (in the barrier sense),  partition, rail, railing, seawall, wall

**Tips:**   When used with the preposition through, this preposition has a sense akin to across.   E.g., Sounds came through the wall.   He came through the door. (Note how the sense of through here differs from through in conduits: Water flowed through (along) the pipe. 

**Caution:**   A number of words that look like they belong here should rather be coded as ASPECTIVES;  e.g.,  entrance, exit, opening, hole, hub, nucleus, center, horizon, gap, intersection, target, ceiling, edge, front, back, side, face. 

The ASPECTIVES code is more appropriate here because these words tend to be aspects of something else;  e.g., center of the city, exit of the building, etc.  (See ASPECTIVES for further explanation.)

A number of words that look like they belong here should rather be coded as PLACE;  e.g., dam, roadblock, border.  PLACE is more appropriate because of the human scale involved and their geographical connotation.

**Developers' Tips:**

           

 

 

                   

 

 

cloth things    [mnemonic: COcloth]    [3 34 785]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Soft things made of fabric, leather, etc.

**Examples:**    afghan, banner, blanket, blouse, curtain, drape, dress, flag, hat, mitten, parka, pennant, rug, sail, scarf, shawl, sheet, shirt, shoe, slacks, slipper, sock, sweater, tie, towel

**Caution:**   Words like clothing, upholstery, carpet should be coded under the MASS Superset.  Words like sleeping bag and pillow case should be coded as receptacles; e.g., Take the pillow from (out of) the pillow case.  

Words like tent should be coded as enclosed space under PLACE to reflect the human scale.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

 

structural elements    [mnemonic: COstruc]    [3 34 612]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Things that function structurally, including parts of the body

**Examples:**   bar, beam, bone, capital, capstone, chassis, column, cornerstone,   frame, gaffe, girder, keystone, lattice, mast, pane, panel, pilaster, pillar,   pole,  post, roof, rafter, rod, shaft, skeleton, spar, strut

**Tips:**   When used with the preposition from, this preposition typically has the sense off of.  E.g., He fell from (off of) the roof. 

Note that roof is a structural element, whereas ceiling is a threshold/focal point/barrier.  (You can remove a roof, but you can't remove a ceiling.)

**Caution:**   Words like paneling, timber, glass are coded under the MASS Superset.  

**Developers' Tips:**

                   

 

                   

concretization of verbals    [mnemonic: COverb]    [3 34 211]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Concrete things derived from a verbal action. 

**Examples:**    carving(s), casting(s), coating(s), covering, knot, mounting, partitioning, projecting, refill, shaving(s), stitch, threading, weld, winding

**Caution:**   This is a narrow set of nouns and should not be confused with strong verbals under ABSTRACT or with functional mass nouns, such as piping, wiring, tubing, planking, etc.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

                   

.. _concretization-of-mass-nouns: 

concretization of mass nouns [mnemonic: COmass]    [3 34 210]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    A noun phrase the first word of which is a mass noun but which does not function as a mass noun because of the head word which is not mass. 

**Examples:**    acid lining, iron vein

**Caution:**   This is a very narrow set of nouns.

**Developers' Tips:**  

 

 
.. _product-brand-names:

product/brand names    [mnemonic: CObrand]    [3 34 209]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Things that are brand names or product names.  This is a very restricted set.  Note the "Cautions" below.

**Examples:**    Camry

**Caution:**   Only entries that are purely product or brand names should be given this code, i.e. do not use this code if the term is also a company name; e.g., Ford.   Doing otherwise can deprive the system of critical intelligence of the word's agentive characteristic.

Do not code brand names which are mass nouns here;  e.g., Kleenex, Sprite, Coke.  Such words should be coded under the MASS Noun Superset. 

Be sure to capitalize the entry to avoid possible confusion with common nouns (e.g. Coke versus coke).

**Developers' Tips:**   

 

                   

undifferentiated functionals   [mnemonic: COundfunc ]    [3 34 217]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns denoting functional concrete things which have not been covered by other categories within the functional set.  

**Examples:**    bauble, gem, jewel, necklace, papillote, pawn, ornament, souvenir, trinket

**Tips:**   If none of the subsets under functionals seem to apply, use COfunc as the undifferentiated set.

 

 

                   

agentives    [mnemonic: COagen ]    [3 35]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Agentives tend to be active, i.e. typically have a source of energy in themselves and do some kind of work of their own accord; hence, the agentive designation. They are contrasted with functionals which tend to be more passive in nature.   

Agentives comprise the following subsets:

* software
* concrete chemical agents
* machines/systems
* vehicles
* meters
* communication agents
* undifferentiated agentive things

**Tips:**   Agentives as distinct from functionals typically have two characteristics: (a) they do work in and of themselves;  (b) they have a source of energy in themselves.  Some functionals like hinge, valve, muffler, armature satisfy (a) but not (b).

Agents play an important role in parsing. 

If none of the subsets under agentives seem to apply, use the undifferentiated set.

**Caution:**   Agentives are always count nouns and, unless pluralized, generally cannot occur without a preceding article or quantifier. For example: \*Computer is effective (illegal).  Computers are effective (legal).   If the word can occur in the singular without an article or quantifier, it should be coded under the MASS Superset.

software    [mnemonic: COsoft ]    [3 35 300]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    All types of computer programs and routines.  This includes both generic terms and specific product names.

**Examples:**    applet, browser, compiler, Coreldraw, form handler, FrontPage, interpreter, Linux, operating system, OS2, PageMaker, patch, Power Point, program, RDBMS, routine, software driver, software application, software editor, software filter, software function, Solaris, spelling checker, spider (Internet sense), subroutine, SunOS, Visio, Windows, wizard

**Tips:**   Include in this subset those software agents which function with some degree of autonomy;  a single line of program instruction would not satisfy this condition.

This category does include firmware.

**Caution:**   The words software and firmware and all compounds ending in these words have the properties of a mass noun and should be coded under functional mass.

Terms like line of code, program instruction, hyperlink, hot button, branch instruction, Do Loop should not be coded here as software under CONCRETE Superset, but as instructional data under INFORMATION Superset. 

Terms like web page, web site should be coded as recorded data under INFORMATION Superset.    

Terms like URL, ASCII, HTML, JAVA should be coded as symbolic data under INFORMATION Superset.

Product names are included here unless the product name is identical with the company name, in which case the word should be coded as proper organization names under the ANIMATE Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

concrete chemical agents   [mnemonic: COchem ]    [3 35 702]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Chemical substances that cause change and do not qualify as MASS Nouns

**Examples:**    catalyst, charge, explosive, fireworks, payload, reagent, sedative, warhead

**Tips:**   Include non-chemical warheads and bombs in this subset. 

**Caution:**   Proper names of medicines and chemicals should be coded under chemical agent in the MASS Noun Superset when such names function as mass nouns; viz., can occur after some in the singular ( i.e., are not count nouns).   For example, some Prozac, some Bufferin, etc.

Product names which are count nouns are included here unless the product name is identical with the company name, in which case the word should be coded as proper organization names under the ANIMATE Superset.

Weapons like guided missiles should be coded as vehicles under agentives; smart bombs should be coded as machines/systems under agentives.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

machines/systems   [mnemonic: COmach ]    [3 35 750]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Hardware or organs that satisfy the conditions of an agent: (a) performs work in and of itself; (b) has its energy source in itself.

**Examples:**    air conditioner, battery, camera, carburetor, computer, drill,   electron microscope, engine, fan, firearm, furnace, generator, heart, laser, liver, microprocessor, monitor, multiplexer, pacemaker, pancreas, printer, radiator, reactor, recorder, refrigerator, scanner, stove, terminal, transformer, weapon

**Tips:**    See general explanation of agentives above.

**Caution:**   Product names are included here unless the product name is identical with the company name, in which case the word should be coded as proper organization names under the ANIMATE Superset.  E.g., Xerox, Gateway, IBM

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

vehicles   [mnemonic: COvehic]    [3 35 611]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Caution:**   Proper names of vehicles, e.g. Buick, Concorde, may be included here.  However, words like Mercedes, Ford, which also denote the manufacturer, should be coded as proper organization names under the ANIMATE Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

meters   [mnemonic: COmeter]    [3 35 716]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Devices that measure or regulate time, distance, speed, intensity, frequency, volume, flow, etc.

**Examples:**    clock, compass, gauge, micrometer, passimeter, penetrometer, radar, rangefinder, sonar, spectrometer, tensometer, thermostat, wristwatch

**Caution:**   Product names are included here unless the product name is identical with the company name, in which case the word should be coded as proper organization names under the ANIMATE Superset.

**Definition:**    Devices for sending and receiving information

**Examples:**    cellular phone, fax, microphone, modulator, monitor, radio, receiver, short-wave, sonar, telegraph, telephone, television, telex, terminal, transmitter, walkie-talkie

**Tips:**   This subset narrowly defines devices for person-to-person communication rather than person-to-machine communication.

**Caution:**   Words like monitor, printer, scanner, recorder are more properly coded as machines/systems under CONCRETE Superset.

Product names are included here unless the product name is identical with the company name, in which case the word should be coded as proper organization names under the ANIMATE Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

undifferentiated agentive things   [mnemonic: COundagt]    [3 35 248]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns denoting agentive concrete things which have not been covered by other categories within the agentive set.  

**Caution:**   Product names are included here unless the product name is identical with the company name, in which case the word should be coded as proper organization names under the ANIMATE Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

natural things    [mnemonic: COnat ]    [3 32]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    This set includes concrete things that exist in the natural world (not man-made objects) and which do not qualify as mass nouns.  These nouns are always count nouns which means that they cannot occur in the singular after quantifiers like more;  e.g., \*more pebble, \*more tree.  The one exception to this is the subset trees/wood which subsumes words like oak, pine and which can function as MASS Nouns; e.g., more oak.

This set has four subsets:

* minute flora
* plants
* trees
* trees/wood
* miscellaneous natural things

**Caution:**  Words which can function as mass nouns, like stone, slate, sky, rain, moss, kelp should be coded under the MASS Superset.

 

 

 

minute flora   [mnemonic: COflora]    [3 32 382]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Diminutive concrete things that exist in the natural world; i.e., are not man-made objects

**Examples:**   alga, algae, spore 

**Caution:**   This set does not include minute animates, such as paramecium, flagella which should be coded as microscopic under the ANIMATE Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

plants   [mnemonic: COplant]    [3 32 383]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**  Names of plants, flowers, weeds, brush, etc. 

**Examples:**  amaryllis, bindweed, blackthorn, blossom, carnation, clove, flower, lilac, nettle, pansy, plant, primrose, rose, vine, violet, weed

**Caution:**  If the plant is edible, it should be coded as edible under the CONCRETE Superset (e.g., beet) or, if a mass noun, like broccoli or rice, as mass edible under the MASS Superset.

Words like grass, wheat, flax, rye, being mass nouns (e.g., more wheat), should be coded as vegetative mass under the MASS Superset. 

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

trees   [mnemonic: COtree]    [3 32 384]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Names of trees that do not also denote the wood.  These are count nouns (e.g., more poplars).  Words which denote both trees and wood can function as mass nouns (e.g. more oak).   

**Examples:**    hazel, holly, mimosa, palm, persimmon, piassava, poplar, willow

**Tips:**  To qualify for this category, the noun must not describe wood or food where the primary association is with wood (e.g., oak) or with food (e.g., olive). 

**Caution:**   Trees whose wood is a mass noun, e.g. more oak, should be coded as trees/wood under the CONCRETE Superset.

Words like orange, lemon, olive, grapefruit and pistachio denote both trees and food and, in the case of orange, lemon, and olive, also color.  If the primary association is the food, these words should be coded as edibles or edibles/color under CONCRETE Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

trees/wood   [mnemonic: COtrwd ]    [3 32 855]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Names of trees whose wood is a Mass Noun (e.g. more oak).   

**Examples:**    ash, cedar, elm, fir, maple, oak, pine, redwood

**Caution:**   Trees whose wood is not a Mass Noun, e.g more poplars, should be coded as trees under the CONCRETE Superset.

Note that the word wood itself is encoded under the MASS Noun Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**    This entire subset is treated as a mass noun by the parser.

 

 

miscellaneous natural things [mnemonic: COmnat ]    [3 32 381]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns denoting natural things which have not been covered by other categories within the natural set.

Celestial sources of light such as sun, moon, planets, stars, constellations, comets (but not meteors) are coded as geographical locations under the PLACE Superset.

Luminosity, luster are quality/property/nature under the ABSTRACT Superset.

Words like reflection and radiation are strong verbals under the ABSTRACT Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

marks/blemishes   [mnemonic: COmark ]    [3 44]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Caution:**  If an edible thing has the properties of a mass noun, it should be coded as mass edible under the MASS Superset (e.g. broccoli, asparagus).

If an edible thing also describes a color, it should be coded as edibles/color under the CONCRETE Superset (e.g. orange, almond). 

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

edibles/color   [mnemonic: COedcol]    [3 18 855]

MASS Noun Superset  [mnemonic: MA]     [11]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:**   MASS Nouns denote a wide variety of physical things, such as money, grass, energy, food, steel, etc. that have a special property that distinguishes them from count nouns. This property is described below.

1.  Mass nouns commonly occur in the singular without articles (quantifiers), as in the following sentences: 

* We need more oil.
* We need to buy gas. 
* More grain was sent to the disaster area.

2.  Mass nouns, unlike count nouns, occur in the singular after quantifiers like any, enough, little, some, more, etc; e.g., some wine, enough sand, more gold.

Unlike mass nouns, count nouns following one of these quantifiers require a plural form:

* We need more pencils.
* We need to buy lamps.  
* More trucks were sent to the disaster area.

The MASS Superset has the following sets:

* raw materials/metals
* functional mass
* financial mass
* energy
* vegetative
* animate
* natural minerals/solids
* chemical agents
* chemical compounds
* liquids
* edible mass
* gases
* wastes
* undifferentiated mass

**Caution:**  Some codes besides the MASS Superset have the mass noun property.  For example,

* trees/wood subset (e.g. oak) under CONCRETE Superset 
* edibles/color subset (e.g. orange) under CONCRETE Superset
* mammals/food/fur subset (e.g. fox) under ANIMATE Superset
* fowl/food subset (e.g. duck) under ANIMATE Superset
* remote mass subset (e.g. room)

Use these rather than the MASS Superset in such cases.

**Developers' Tips:**    A unique subset code, remote mass  [mnemonic: remass]  [855] is available for assignment to any noun having mass noun characteristics where provision for such is not otherwise made in the superset to which it belongs.

Certain sets and subsets of the ABSTRACT Superset, like general abstract concepts (e.g. justice), are treated as mass nouns by definition.

 

 

 

raw materials/metals   [mnemonic: MAraw]     [11 38]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Raw, solid materials out of which things are made

**Tips:**   The distinction between this set and functional mass can be seen in the distinction between glass and glassware.

You can distinguish between this set and minerals/solids by this simple test: Can some product be made of this material?  Typically, only raw materials/ metals satisfies this test.

**Caution:**  Be sure that your entry is not a count noun and has the properties of a MASS Noun.

**Developers' Tips:**

Not all words dealing with finance are mass nouns obviously.  Words like dollar and cent are coded as units of money/value in the MEASURE Superset. 

Words like bond and insurance policy are coded as instructional data in the INFORMATION Superset.

Words that are both abstract concepts measured by unit under the MEASURE Superset (e.g, wealth, income, etc) and financial mass should be placed under the latter as the code with the higher priority.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

.. _proper organization names: 

proper organization names  [mnemonic: ANorg]    [5 94 193]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Proper names of established organizations

**Examples:**    Airbus, Amtrak, American Medical Association (AMA), Congress, FBI, Ford, Gateway, IBM, Kremlin, Logos, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, NASA, OPEC, Parliament, Reuters, Supreme Court, Toyota

**Tips:**   These words always have initial caps.

**Caution:**   Words like Washington, Wall Street, White House which are strictly speaking not proper names of organizations (but which have a human collective connotation) and also denote places, should be coded under the PLACE Superset.

Organizational names which are also used to denote products (e.g., Toyota, Ford, Mercedes, IBM, Xerox, Logos) should be coded here rather than under the code for the thing they represent. 

It is usually not possible to distinguish between product name (IBM) and company name (IBM) on the basis of subject matter codes (SMC) because a text with that subject matter would typically use the word in both ways.  Therefore, a choice has to be made, in this case, in favor of the company that produced the product.

**Developers' Tips:**    In translating words like IBM, Xerox into languages like French, the treatment differs, depending on whether the noun denotes an organization or a product.  In French, the organization would not have an article, the product would.   Since the SAL code here for proper organization names is ambiguous, the decision must rely on the syntactic analysis of the parse.  E.g., an IBM would signify the product whereas IBM used without a quantifier would signify the company.

**Tips:**   This whole category should be treated as remote mass.  The reason is that the designation for food taken from these animals is most usually a mass noun.

**Caution:**   Terms for mammals like lamb, deer, that also denote food, and terms like seal, fox, that also denote fur or hide, can also function syntactically as mass nouns.  Such terms must be coded mammals/food/fur in order to capture this mass noun property (e.g. more lamb, more fox).

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

mammals/food/fur  [mnemonic: ANmammfd]    [5 51 855]

PLACE Noun Superset  [mnemonic: PL]   [9]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:**    Nouns denoting place, geographical entities, and geographical locations.

Sets within the PLACE Superset are:

* functional locations
* enclosed spaces
* paths
* non-agentive common-noun geog. locations
* agentive geographical entities
* non-agentive proper geog. entities
* undifferentiated place nouns

**Tips:**   PLACE Nouns are distinguished from CONCRETE Nouns by their human scale. Thus, words like box, drawer are receptacles under CONCRETE Superset; words like parlor, shed are enclosed spaces under PLACE Superset.

PLACE Noun coding reflects two important distinctions:  (1) agentive/non-agentive and (2) proper name/common noun.  In combination, these are:

* agentive proper name places.  These include the following subsets:
    * countries, states, provinces (PLcoun)
       e.g. France, Minnesota
    * cities (PLcity)
       e.g. Paris, Berlin
* agentive common name places.  These include the following subsets:
    * agentive functional locations (PLagfunc)
            e.g. bank,  post office
    * agentive common noun geo. entities (PLagcom)
            e.g. borough, city
* non-agentive proper name places.  These include the following subsets:
    * continents (PLcont), e.g. Africa
    * bodies of water (PLwater), e.g. North Sea
    * other non-agentive proper geo. entities                        (PLothprop), e.g. Swiss Alps
* non-agentive common name places.  These include the following subsets: 
    * non-agentive common geo. locations (PLnagcom),         e.g, beach, sky, forest
    * all other subsets are included under this category as well.

    Since PLACE Noun codes are mutually exclusive, the coder should experience no difficulty with coding priorities here.

**Caution:**   In coding PLACE Nouns, be mindful of the possible presence of an agentive property of a word (e.g. the agentive city vs. the non-agentive cliff).   If this property exists in your entry, be sure to select the appropriate agentive subset if one exists.  E.g., city would be coded agentive unnamed geog. locations.

Some words which might appear to belong to the PLACE Superset also have other meanings which may require their being given a different code.  For example, property should be coded properties/qualities/nature under ABSTRACT Superset, that being the more fundamental meaning of property. Riverfront property, on the other hand, lacks this ambiguity and is indeed a PLACE Noun.

A number of words have multiple meanings only one of which is PLACE. In many cases, the other meanings take precedence.  For example:

* property should be properties/qualities/nature under ABSTRACT Superset
* cell should be microorganism under ANIMATE Superset
* parcel should be undiff.  concrete object under CONCRETE Superset
* domain should be field of knowledge under INFORMATION Superset
* clearance, emplacement, excavation, crossing, claim should be strong verbal        under ABSTRACT Superset

Any of the above can, of course, be coded as PLACE Noun if modified; e.g. riverfront property, railway crossing, gun emplacement, etc.  Also, the assignment of subject matter codes (SMC) at time of entry via TermBuilder can determine the code of a noun in one direction or another.

**Developers' Tips:**    A few PLACE Nouns such as space, land, ground, room have a MASS Noun property.  To reflect this property they are given the unique subset remote mass code [855] to alert the parser.

 

 

 

 

functional locations [mnemonic: PLfunc]    [9 26]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Names of locations where a specific function is performed.   

**Examples:**    airfield, airdrome, amphitheater, anchorage, arena, arsenal, barber shop, battlefield, battleground, beauty parlor, bullring, campgrounds, campsite,  cleaners, confectionery, construction site, control point, courtroom, diner, delicatessen, depository, dock, dormitory, drilling platform, drugstore, dumpsite, farmyard, fish market, garage, gas station, gymnasium, hostel, hothouse, icehouse, junkyard, kitchen, landing field, launching site, shelter, spa, theater

**Tips:**   Words in this set do not typically function as human agents.  For example, one would not expect to hear:
      The dock plans to expand its operation.  
      The graveyard announced a new policy. 

Terms which can be used as human agents, (e.g. university, bank, factory, academy, airport, armory, arsenal, hospital, nursing home, etc.) should be coded as functional locations (agentive)

**Developers' Tips:**  

 

 

 

agentive functional locations [mnemonic: PLagfunc]    [9 26 228]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Names of locations where a specific function is performed.   Words in this subset can also function in the capacity of human agents; e.g., as subjects of verbs like think, plan, intend, etc.

**Examples:**   abbey, academy, airport, air base, bank, bureau, depot, dispensary, factory, fire station, hospice, hospital, museum, office, post office, school, shipyard, spa, supermarket, university, Wall Street, White House

**Tips:**   These terms can frequently be used to denote human agents; for example:
               The university has decided to hire a new instructor.   
               The bank has announced new business hours for the summer.

enclosed spaces  [mnemonic: PLencl]    [9 27]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Physical space on the human scale which has the sense of being enclosed

**Examples:**    abode, accommodations, adobe, alcove, annex, anthill, apartment, arbor, arcade, boudoir, booth, cabin, cellar, chateau, closet, coop, dungeon, dormitory, foyer, grave, hangar, homestead, house, hovel, hut, kennel, lobby, lounge, manor, pantry, room, salon, shed, shop, suite, turret, vault, veranda        

**Tips:**   When the preposition from precedes nouns in this set, the preposition has the sense of out of.  For example:
          Crowds flowed from the theater. 
          The celebrity came from her apartment.

**Caution:**   Accommodations (pl) is an enclosed space, but in the singular it should be coded as a strong verbal.  

The line between enclosed spaces and functional locations may sometimes seem arbitrary. If the term seems to emphasize functionality, such as delicatessen, workshop, convent, it should be coded as functional locations.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

paths  [mnemonic: PLpath]    [9 55]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Places that have the general structure of a path

**Examples:**   canal, channel, corridor, hallway, orbit, path, railway, river, road, stream, straits, subway, trajectory, tributary

**Tips:**   This subset should not be confused with conduits under the CONCRETE Superset.   The distinction has to do with the human scale of paths.

Although in some sense a path, words like bridge, trestle, ramp, etc. should be coded as links under CONCRETE Superset and not here under paths despite the human scale of both.   This is because bridges are concrete things in a way that paths are not.   Conversely, a path is geographical in a way that a bridge is not.

non-agentive common-noun geog. locations [mnemonic: PLnagcom]    [9 29]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   General geographical locations which are not proper names and which are non-agentive in nature.

**Examples:**   bay, beach, border, coast, countryside, forest, frontier, hemisphere, neighborhood, ocean, sky, upper airspace

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

 

agentive geog. entities  [mnemonic: PLaggeo]    [9 94]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   These are geographical entities with proper names.

* There are three subsets under this set:
* countries/states/provinces
* cities
* agentive common-noun geog. entities

**Caution:**   Place names like France, New York, Ontario comprise a country/ state/ province subset under PLACE Superset, but share a set code with human collective of the ANIMATE Superset. This anomaly occurs because of the identification of a country with its people. E.g., France produces great wine.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

countries/states/provinces  [mnemonic: PLcoun]    [9 94 230]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Proper names of countries, states, provinces.  These are agentive by definition.

**Examples:**    Australia, Brazil, California, Ecuador, England, Florida, France, India, Nigeria, Ontario, Poland, Quebec, Sicily, Tasmania

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

cities [mnemonic: PLcity]    [9 94 226]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Proper names of cities.  These are agentive by definition.

**Developers' Tips:**   

 

 

 

 

 

agentive common-noun geog. entities [mnemonic: PLagcom]    [9 94 236]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Terms for geographical locations which are not proper names and which are often used to denote human agents (e.g., the city plans to......).

**Examples:**   borough, city, county, country, district, duchy, earldom, emirate, empire, kingdom, municipality, precinct, province, republic, state, town, township village

**Tips:**   Entries here are always common nouns.  Entries which are proper names of geographical locations are coded under their appropriate "named" subset in the PLACE Superset.

non-agentive proper geog. entities [mnemonic: PLnagprop]    [9 56]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   These are non-agentive geographical entities with proper names.

* There are three subsets of named entities under this set:
* continents

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

continents [mnemonic: PLcont]    [9 56 227]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Proper names for the continents.  These are non-agentive by definition.

**Examples:**   Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, South America

undifferentiated place nouns  [mnemonic: PLundif]    [9 57]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Nouns denoting place of a very general nature which have not been covered by other categories within the PLACE Superset.

INFORMATION Noun Superset  [mnemonic: IN]    [12]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:**    The INFORMATION Noun Superset is comprised of nouns that denote data, information, or knowledge. This category also includes the medium on which the information is recorded, represented or communicated;  i.e., spoken, written, dramatized, sung, etc. 

Sets and subsets within the INFORMATION Noun Superset are as follows:

* instructional/legal
* games/rituals
* symbolic data
* recorded data
* scripted events
* evidence/symptoms
* fields of knowledge
* the arts
* storage media for recorded data
* undifferentiated information

**Caution:**   Many nouns that denote physical objects that would seem to belong to the CONCRETE Noun Superset should actually be coded as INFORMATION Nouns;  e.g. newspaper, map, paperback, dictionary, floppy disk, cassette, etc.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

.. _instructional-legal: 

instructional/legal  [mnemonic: INinst]    [12 74]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns that designate policy, directions, orders, commands, etc.

**Examples:**    affidavit, branch, bylaw, certificate, charter, contract, covenant, direction, directive, edict, guarantee, instruction, law, manual, norm, notice, order, prescription, prophecy, protocol, recipe, rule, schedule, standard, statute

**Tips:**    Words in this set tend to have an agentive character;  e.g., the statute requires that . . .;  the regulation calls for. . . .  Thus, these terms tend to have a hortatory or regulatory character rather than a mere descriptive or informational character. 

Terms like line of code, program instruction, hyperlink, hot button, branch instruction, Do Loop should be coded here as instructional data and not as software under CONCRETE Superset.

Terms like web page, web site should be coded as recorded data under INFORMATION Superset.    

Terms like URL, ASCII, HTML, JAVA should be coded as symbolic data under INFORMATION Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

games/rituals [mnemonic: INgame]    [12 74 224]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Games or rituals performed according to written rules

**Examples:**   baseball, basketball, chess, cards, checkers, dominoes, football, hockey, lacrosse, liturgy, lottery, poker, rugby, vespers

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

symbolic data  [mnemonic: INsymb]    [12 75]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns that denote information or knowledge recorded in symbolic form

**Examples:**   address, algorithm, alphabet, asterisk, backslash, cedilla, circumflex, character, chord, code, coefficient, colon, conjunction, determiner, ellipsis, flat,   formula, hyphen, infinitive, language, letter, noun, number, parameter, octave, qualifier, radical, sharp, signal, staff, typeface, variable, verb, vowel

**Tips:**    Terms like URL, ASCII, HTML, JAVA should be coded here as symbolic data.

Terms like web page, web site should be coded  as recorded data under INFORMATION Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

recorded data  [mnemonic: INdata]    [12 76]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns that denote information or knowledge that has been recorded

**Examples:**   album, artwork, atlas, best seller, biography, book, brochure, calendar, casebook, data sheet, diary, dictionary, dossier, engraving, essay, flowchart, graph, leaflet, letter, manuscript, map, message, newspaper, paperback, placard, picture, portfolio, registry, script, sentence, telegram

**Tips:**   Terms like web page, web site should be coded here as recorded data.

Terms like URL, ASCII, HTML, JAVA should be coded as symbolic data under INFORMATION Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

.. _scripted-events: 

scripted events [mnemonic: INevent]    [12 76 223]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Nouns that denote data, information, knowledge, etc. imparted in a specific moment of time through speaking, writing, dramatization, song, etc., and usually recorded in a script or score.

**Examples:**  aria, cinema, cantata, concert, farce, homily, lecture, movie, operetta, oratorio, overture, pantomime, postlude, radio program, recital, revue, sermon, speech, symphony, TV show

**Tips:**   Because of their informational content, words such as sermon, homily, lecture, concert, recital should be coded here as scripted events rather than as time events under the ABSTRACT Superset. 

**Caution:**   The distinction between scripted events and the arts may seem arbitrary in some cases;   e.g., opera is coded under the arts, and operetta is coded under scripted events.  The justification for this is that opera denotes a field of study as well as an event, whereas operetta would seem to denote only a scripted event.  The same can be held true for drama vs. movies; for poetry vs. recital, etc.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

evidence/symptoms [mnemonic: INevid]    [12 96]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns denoting evidence, indications, symptoms, signs.

**Examples:**   auspice, clue, cue, evidence, example, hint, portent, premonition,  proof, sighting, signal, symptom, syndrome

**Caution:**  Words like diagnosis, prediction should be coded as strong verbals under ABSTRACT Superset because of their pronounced verbal coloration.

**Developers' Tips:**  

 

 

 

 

fields of knowledge   [mnemonic: INknow]    [12 78]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Nouns that denote fields of knowledge, study, research, etc., including specialty fields and hobbies

**Examples:**   agriculture, botany, chemistry, criminology, crystallography, cybernetics, data processing, ecology, forestry, genetics, geriatrics, heuristics, history, hydrology, linguistics, medicine, mineralogy, philately, philosophy, photography,   psychology,technology, topography, typography, zoology

**Developers' Tips:**

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns that denote spoken, written, dramatized, sung or similarly presented material within the sphere of the arts

**Examples:**   acrobatics, ballet, calypso, comedy, drama, folk music, jazz, judo, karate, melodrama, music, opera, poetry, sumo, swing, tragedy

**Caution:**   The distinction between the arts and  scripted events may seem arbitrary in some cases;  e.g., opera is coded under the arts, and operetta is coded under scripted events.  The justification for this is that opera denotes a field of study as well as an event, whereas operetta would seem to denote only a scripted event.  The same can be held true for drama vs. movies; for poetry vs. recital, etc.

**Developers' Tips:**    Many words in this subset are "apposition-inviting";  e.g., the opera Carmen;  the ballet Swan Lake, etc.  PARSE1/TRAN1 rules should be written to capture this relationship;  e.g., DET(the) N(INarts) N * > NP

 

 

 

 

 

storage media for recorded data [mnemonic: INstor]    [12 77]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns that designate places where data may be stored

**Examples:**   buffer, boot disk, cartridge, cassette, CD ROM, data base, disk, file, floppy disk, general ledger, hard disk, magnetic tape, microfiche, notepad, page, print library, register, tablet, tape reel, workstation file

**Tips:**   If the recording medium is a place, such as register, buffer, writing tablet, or notebook, code it in this category.  If the recording medium is a mass noun, such as computer memory or computer store, code the word as a functional mass in the MASS Noun Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

undifferentiated information [mnemonic: INundif]    [12 79]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns denoting information which have not been covered by other categories within the INFORMATION Superset.

**Examples:**   adage, background course, background fact, cliche, filetalk, in-depth knowledge, information, specifics, subject, topic

**Developers' Tips:**

 
 
.. _abstract-noun-superset: 

ABSTRACT Noun Superset  [mnemonic: AB ]    [6]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:**    The ABSTRACT Noun Superset contains three sets of abstract nouns.  These are:
* verbal abstracts
* non-verbal abstracts
* general concepts

verbal abstracts describes procedures, behavior, actions and persons/things as agents.  non-verbal abstracts describes qualities, conditions, and relationships of things or persons as non-agents (patients).  This set also includes concepts relating to classifications of things/persons and source or origin of things/persons.  general concepts pertain to such general ideas as as justice, Buddhism, etc. 

Priority for parsing purposes is verbal, non-verbal and general, in that order. Note that verbal abstracts often take verbal complementation. To illustrate, note  how differently the verbal and non-verbal abstracts codes function in the following sentences.  

(1)   There are three ways of cooking lentils. 

(2)  There are three types of cooking utensils.

In (1), the abstract noun ways is a verbal abstract because it takes a verbal complement (cooking is a verb here).

In (2), the abstract noun types is a non-verbal abstract, and as a consequence cooking here is interpreted by the parser as an adjective.

**Caution:**   Verbal abstracts are the most critical of all codes in parsing a sentence because of the syntactic relationships that this class of nouns tends to have. It is these codes that allow the parser to recognize these relationships.  See specific sets for further discussion.

 

 
 

verbal abstracts  (re processes, behavior, persons as agents)  [mnemonic: ABverb]    [6 41]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Verbal abstract nouns are so-called because they (1) anticipate a verbal complement (e.g., procedure for editing text);  (2) denote a time event (e.g., birthday party); (3) denote a process, action or result of same (e.g., noise abatement). 

The verbal abstract subsets are as follows:

* purpose
* method/process/procedure
* cause/potential/disposition
* quality of action/agent
* negative causes
* strong verbals
* time events
* contrary events
* undifferentiated verbal abstracts

**Tips:**   A noun may be coded as a verbal abstract if it can introduce a verbal complement, as in the following constructions:

* verbal abstract + INFINITVE as in
* the courage to fight 
* a reason to adjust
* the power to resist
* verbal abstract + PREP + V'ING,  as in
* his fairness in dealing
* a talent for acting
* the task of solving

How used:  Verbal abstract codes tell the translation system to expect a possible verbal complement to the right of the noun.  For example, in the phrase, Her ease in handling the situation was..., the verbal abstract code for ease enables the system to recognize that in handling the situation should be attached to ease, thus treating the entire phrase as NP

**Developers' Tips:** The motivation for verbal abstract codes is to allow the system to distinguish between TO + VERB constructions that are (1) noun complements, as opposed to (2) adverbial clauses;  e.g., (1) He has the ability to do the job versus (2) He bought a car to impress his friends.   In (2), the verb particle to has the sense of in order to.

 

 

purpose [mnemonic: ABpur]    [6 41 748]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Abstract nouns denoting purposes, intentions, objectives, goals, and which take a verbal complement.

**Examples:**    function, mission, objective, problem, task

How used:   As pre-verbal to constructions such as to verb, of v'ing, in v'ing

**Tips:**   A noun may be coded purpose if it can introduce a verbal complement, as in the following constructions:

NOUN [ABpur] + TO + INFINITIVE as in mission to do s.t. 

NOUN [ABpur] + OF + V'ING as in task of doing s.t.. 

NOUN [ABpur] + IN + V'ING as in objective in doing s.t.

**Caution:**   If your entry is a compound that already includes the verbal complement (e.g., equation solving problem, computing task, revision function), then it should not be coded as purpose, but as undifferentiated verbal abstract [ABverb].

**Developers' Tips:**   

 

 

 

method/process/procedure [mnemonic: ABmeth]    [6 41 733]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Abstract nouns denoting methods, means, etc. and which take a verbal complement.

**Examples:**   manner, means, method, mode, plan, technique, way

How Used:   As pre-verbal to constructions such as for v'ing, of v'ing, to verb 

**Tips:**  A noun may be coded method/process/procedure if it can introduce a verbal complement, as in the following constructions:  

NOUN [ABmeth] + FOR = V'ING as in method for doing s.t.

NOUN [ABmeth] + OF + V'ING as in way of doing s.t.

NOUN [ABmeth] +TO +  INFINITIVE as in means to do s.t.

**Caution:**   If your entry is a compound that already includes the verbal complement (e.g., equation solving method, computing mode, revision plan), then it should not be coded as method, but as undifferentiated verbal abstract [ABverb].

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

cause/potential/disposition [mnemonic: ABcause]    [6 41 602]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Abstract nouns that describe cause, reason, motivation, readiness, etc.; i.e., cause, potential or disposition for action and which take a verbal complement.

**Examples:**    ability, basis, effort, factor, interest, mind, motivation, patience, perseverance, persistence, power, readiness, reason, reluctance, right, sense, skill, suitability, talent, urgency

How Used:   As pre-verbal to constructions such as for v'ing, to verb

* Nouns in this subset usually answer one of the questions: 
* Why does the person do it? 
* What is the source of the action? 
* What is the reason for the action?  E.g., interest? talent? urgency?

A noun may be coded cause/potential/disposition if it can introduce a verbal complement, as in the following constructions:

NOUN [ABcause] + FOR + V'ING as in basis for doing s.t.

NOUN [ABcause] + TO + INFINITIVE as in reason to do s.t.

**Caution:**   Words like patience, perseverance, persistence belong under this subset rather than under quality of action/agent, which follows. This is because cause/potential/disposition abstracts can be complemented with to verb, whereas quality of action/agent nouns (efficiency, ease, brevity) can only be complemented with in v'ing.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

quality of action/agent [mnemonic: ABqual]    [6 41 655]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Abstract nouns describing the quality of an action, process, or the   one acting, and which take the specific verbal complement in v'ing.  E.g., accuracy in coding. 

**Examples:**    accuracy, aggressiveness, brevity, ease, efficiency, industriousness, playfulness, rapidity, suitableness, tenacity

How Used:   These nouns take in v'ing complements.

**Tips:**   Nouns in this category describe the quality of an agent or action.  They often answer the question: "How does s/he do it?" 

A noun may be coded in this subset if it can introduce the verbal complement in v'ing, as in the following:

NOUN [ABqual] + IN + V'ING as in rapidity in doing s.t.

**Caution:**  If the noun in question can also be complemented by an infinitive clause, it does not belong here, but most probably under cause/potential/disposition.   This applies to nouns like patience, perseverance, persistence, etc.  E.g., They had the patience to master the method.  They had the skill to do the job. 

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

negative causes [mnemonic: ABnegc]    [6 41 764]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    A narrow class of abstract nouns that describe causes, dispositions that are negative in their effect, and which take the complements of v'ing and/or to verb.  This is a negative variant of the cause/potential/ disposition subset.

**Examples:**   burden, cost, danger, fear, ordeal, peril, reluctance, risk, threat

How Used:   As pre-verbal to constructions such as to verb, of v'ing. 

E.g., danger of collapsing;  threat of being attacked;  risk of hurting someone;  fear of flying;  burden of proving innocence;  reluctance to comply;  ordeal of losing weight, etc.

**Tips:**   Nouns in this subset usually answer the question why a thing should not be done.

Nouns in this subset may introduce a verbal complement, as in the following constructions:

NOUN [ABnegc] + TO + INFINITIVE as in a threat to do s.t.

NOUN [ABnegc] + OF + V'ING as in the risk of doing s.t.

**Caution:**   If the noun in question is already modified by a verbal complement, e.g., building costs, war threat, it should not be coded here, but probably under strong verbals below.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

.. _strong-verbals: 

strong verbals: actions/processes/behavior or the result of same [mnemonic: ABstrvb]    [6 41 749] 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    A broad class of nouns or noun phrases that denote an action, process, behavior or result of same. Strong verbals that govern prepositions, as illustrated below, take codes reflecting their governance (not including of however)  (See Prep Governance chart below.)

Strong verbals should not be confused with PROCESS Nouns. (See "Caution" below.)

The basic distinction between PROCESS Nouns and strong verbals is that PROCESS Nouns (e.g., indication) are convertible to verbs in certain constructions; (e.g., make an indication = indicate).  PROCESS Nouns are always single words.  Whenever the entry of a  PROCESS Noun contains an adjective or other noun modifying it, meaning, in effect, that it cannot be converted to a verb, that entry becomes strong verbal by definition.

**Examples of strong verbals that do not govern prepositions:**

Strong verbals derived from the -ing verb form:
board meeting, default sorting, dial pulsing, digital switching, information processing, hard disk partitioning, information processing, schedule planning, tape file processing, video conferencing

N.B. All single word -ing entries must be coded as PROCESS Nouns.  In order for an -ing form to qualify as a strong verbal, it must be modified, that is, must be a noun phrase.  

**Examples of strong verbals derived from the verb infinitive:**
Big Bang, buy, cable transfer, coffee break,  congressional veto, data control, data exchange, dichotomizing search, dig, discard, dodge, dole, drink, economic forecast, forms control, grammar check, guess, long distance call, memory lapse, on-line help, pay cut, phone call, programming change, triple click, vow

**Examples of strong verbals expressing result of action, process, behavior:**
bargain, military build-up, charge-back, coup, data entry, dispersal, Doppler effect, early checkout, financial oversight, hypnosis, mix, misconduct, mistrial, motion, mount/ dismount operation, outlay, outlook, ovation, retrofit, snow removal, startup, suicide, systems backup, takeoff, traffic, water storage

N.B.  All of the above strong verbals bear the same code.  On the other hand, the strong verbals in the box below govern prepositions and take codes to reflect their governance.  E.g., food distribution (to);   money transfer (to);  merger (with);  outlook (on). 

**Caution:**   Do not confuse strong verbals with PROCESS Nouns (e.g., amendment, illustration, absorption).  Unlike PROCESS Nouns, strong verbals cannot be transformed back into verbs. When PROCESS Nouns like absorption and distribution are modified (e.g. heat absorption, dividend distribution), they cannot transform back into the verb from which they derive;  hence, they become strong verbals.  Other types of strong verbals are those nouns which are strongly verbal but don't come from a verb.  For example, shutdown is an action, but shutdown is not a verb.

Be sure to consider the preposition governance of strong verbals, as these codes are critical to parsing.  Do not consider the preposition of in this connection however, as it is almost always genitival, introducing the subject or object of the verbal rather than a true complement.

.. _time-events:

time events [mnemonic: ABtime]    [6 41 732]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Abstract nouns that denote events or happenings in time

**Examples:**    birthday party, Christmas, convention, end time, feast, holiday, instance, moment, pageant, parade, pause, picnic, stop time, wedding reception

**Tips:**   A word falls into the category of time events if it qualifies as follows:
* the event does NOT have explicit verbal content; e.g., job execution
* the event must be fixed/focused in time; e.g., birthday party, start time
* the event may also have a formal quality; e.g., bridal shower  
* the event is not a natural phenomenon of time; e.g., solstice

**Caution:**   Words which have explicit verbal content, such as disarmament, disbarment, disinheritance, fireworks, fistfight, forfeiture, groan, happening, hatching, hitting, hookup, horseplay, internment, job execution, rehearsal, pilgrimage, layoff, libation, though they occur in time should not be coded as time events, but as strong verbals.

Because of their informational content, words such as sermon, homily, lecture, concert, recital should be coded as recorded events under the INFORMATION Superset.

Words like miracle, phenomenon do not satisfy the fixed/focused time conditions cited above and should be coded as strong verbals.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

contrary events [mnemonic: ABcont]    [6 41 765]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    A very restricted class of abstract nouns that designate an event or happening contrary to the expected and can be used in the context make provision for to mean take precaution against.

**Examples:**    accident, blizzard, catastrophe, disaster, error, navigation error, power surge, theft

How Used:   If constructions like make provision for X have the meaning take precaution against, then X = a contrary event noun.   E.g., This system makes provision for spelling errors = This system takes precaution against spelling errors. 

**Tips:**   A noun need not indicate a catastrophe or accident to be classified as a contrary event, but simply be an event contrary to the expected, such as overflow.

**Caution:**   Words like pandemonium, bedlam, panic, pestilence, plague, pile-up, although contrary do not satisfy the condition cited above that make provision for means take precaution against.  This subset should only be used in the restricted sense described above.

undifferentiated verbal abstracts (re processes, behavior, persons as agents)  [mnemonic: ABverb]    [6 41 41]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns denoting verbal concepts which do not fall within the other subsets of verbal abstracts.

**Examples:**    acting technique, computing task, distribution processs, error- correction procedure, fact-finding mission, reading readiness, navigation skill, writing talent

**Tips:**   Note that in the examples above, the head noun would normally be coded elsewhere under verbal abstracts were it not for the fact of their verbal modification.   

**Caution:**   Be sure to bear in mind the point given in the tip above when coding compound nouns under verbal abstract subsets. 

This distinction is important so that the system will not misconstrue the verbal clauses in the following sentences:

      (1)  He developed new error-correcting procedures to lower costs.
      (2)  She studied acting techniques to advance her career.
      (3)  She developed a new procedure to prioritize tasks.

In (1) and (2), the particle to has the sense of in order to.  If procedures and techniques in these sentences had been coded as method/process/procedure, the system would have seen the verbal clause as complementary to the noun, as in (3), rather than as adverbial to the sentence in effect,and therefore would not have have assigned the sense of to to the particle in order to.

In many target languages, e.g, French and German, this distinction is obviously very critical to the translation.

non-verbal abstracts (re things, persons as non-agents)  [mnemonic: ABnonvb]    [6 40]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Non-verbal abstracts are so-called because they (1) describe  things or persons as non-agents and (2) anticipate a genitival complement (e.g., size of the head) and never a verbal complement.

The non-verbal abstract subsets are as follows:

* properties/qualities/nature
* states/conditions/relationships
* classifications
* sources/origins

**Caution:**    Concepts about persons in this set are always concepts of persons as non-agents; i.e., patients.  Concepts describing persons or things as agents should be coded as quality of action/agent under the verbal set above.

Because this set takes genitival complementation, it bears some resemblance to the ASPECTIVE Superset.  If a word could appear in both, favor the non-verbal abstract set which is a higher classification.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

properties/qualities/nature  [mnemonic: ABprop]    [6 40 609]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Abstract nouns that describe the inherent (intrinsic) nature of a person or thing

**Examples:**   clarity, color, design, feature, form, format, likeableness, pattern, profile, shape, trait 

**Caution:**   Words like effectiveness, decisiveness, aggressiveness describe persons as agents and should be coded under qualities of actions/agents.

Before you code a word as a non-verbal abstract, consider first whether the noun could be a verbal abstract since that is a higher priority.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

states/conditions/relationships [mnemonic: ABstate]    [6 40 736]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Abstract nouns that describe something about a thing or person that is not inherent to its nature.  

**Examples:**    cancer, coma, circumstance, condition, disease, fatherhood, inequality, insolvency, loneliness, parity, poverty, status

**Tips:**   Being more extrinsic, these states, conditions, relationships could conceivably change without altering the nature of the thing or person.  This is not a strict rule but is indicative of the difference between this subset and the properties/ qualities /nature subset above.

**Caution:**    Before you code a word as a non-verbal abstract, consider first whether the noun could be a verbal abstract since that is a higher priority.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

classifications [mnemonic: ABclass]    [6 40 731]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    A narrow set of terms that denote classification.

**Examples:**    animal kingdom, blood type, category, class, configuration type, data type, division, domain, genus, kind, make, nature, personality type, phenotype, phylum, rank, species, type, variety, vintage

**Caution:**   These words might seem to overlap with the configurations/order set under the ASPECTIVE Superset which includes words like series, spectrum, assortment, arrangement or with the aggregate set under the ASPECTIVE Superset which includes words like set, ensemble, minority.   These words, however, do not denote classifications.

Words like American, French, etc. are coded as people/language under ANIMATE Superset.

Words like family, league, group, if they refer to humans, should be coded as human collectives under ANIMATE Superset.

Before you code a word as a non-verbal abstract noun, consider first whether the noun could be a verbal abstract since that is a higher priority.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

sources/origins [mnemonic: ABorig]    [6 40 723]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    A narrow class of terms that denote origin or source of things or persons

**Examples:**    ancestry, cache, etymology, fund, genesis, heredity, heritage, inventory, lineage, origin, patrimony, pedigree, pharmacopoeia, reserve, resource, stock, store, well-spring

**Caution:**   Words like mine, quarry, fount, fountain should be coded as follows: mine and quarry are functional locations under PLACE Superset and fount and fountain are receptacles under CONCRETE Superset.  These codes more accurately characterize these nouns.

Before you code a word as a non-verbal abstract noun, consider first whether the noun could be a verbal abstract since that is a higher priority.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

 

general abstract concepts [mnemonic: ABgen]    [6 42]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    All abstract concepts that do not qualify as either verbal or non-verbal, default to the category of general abstracts. As such, general abstracts denote ideas in and of themselves rather than ideas about persons or things. 

**Examples:**    absolutism, absurdity, activism, Americanism,  anachronism, analogy, anarchism, Anglicanism, animism, anomaly, antithesis, anti-terrorism, Bolshevism, Buddhism, Communism, idea, morality, multilingualism, mystery, myth, naturalism, nemesis, neutrality, non-conformism, nonentity, notion, non-violence, regionalism, relativism, relativity, religion, revisionism, romanticism, socialism, truth

**Tips:**   Notice that the examples do not invite genitival complementation in the way that non-verbal abstracts do, or verbal complementation in the way that verbal abstracts do.

**Caution:**   While myth is a general abstract concept, Myth of Sisyphus should be under recorded data and mythology should be a field of knowledge under the INFORMATION Superset.

Before you code a word as a general abstract concept, consider first whether the noun could be verbal or non-verbal.

PROCESS Noun (Intransitive) Superset  [mnemonic: PNin]    [4]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:**    Intransitive PROCESS Nouns are nouns derived from intransitive verbs.  Codes for PROCESS Nouns (noun deverbals) are derived automatically from their verbs, and are not user assigned.

**Examples:**    decrease, drop, increase, movement, oscillation, quarrel

How Used:   In the Logos System, PROCESS Nouns are convertible to verbs and vice versa.  This supports the need for stylistic transformations in translation;  e.g., if needle oscillation occurs * > if needle oscillates.  

Typical Patterns for Intransitive PROCESS Nouns (PN):  

  During/Upon PN Type:

      during PN of NP * > while/when NP V's

      E.g., during oscillation of needle * > while/when needle oscillate

  PN + Occurs Type:

    If an increase in temperature occurs * > if temperature increases

    If a quarrel between parties occurs * > if the parties quarrel

**Tips:**  In the Logos System lexicon, all verbs have two transfers:  (a) the target verb equivalent and (b) the target process noun derived from the verb.  Similarly, all process noun entries have two transfers:  (a) the target process noun equivalent and (b) the target verb derived from the process noun.  This circumstance was made necessary by the fact that some languages prefer the use of nominalized verbs in place of verbs themselves, and thus for translations to be stylistically correct, it could be necessary to transform a source verb into a target process noun and vice versa.

**Caution:**  The strict test of process noun convertibility must be satisfied for an entry to be classified as a process noun.  There are other forms of verbal nouns which are NOT process nouns because they can't be transformed back into verbs.  These are called strong verbals.  For example:

    shutdown:  shutdown is not a verb.

    phone call: The entry can't be transformed to a verb.

    heat absorption: The entry can't be transformed to a verb.

**Developers' Tips:**    Note that a process noun cannot be in the Logos lexicon both as transitive and intransitive.  If a verb can be both transitive and intransitive, the process noun derived from that verb, such as display or change, must be entered as one or the other, based on most likely usage. 

 

PROCESS Noun (Transitive) Superset  [mnemonic: PNtr]    [7]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:**    Transitive PROCESS Nouns are nouns derived from transitive verbs.  E.g., X provides an indication of Y * > X indicates Y.  Codes for PROCESS Nouns (noun deverbals) are derived automatically from their verbs, and are not user assigned.

**Examples:**    indication, removal, separation, display, transformation

How Used:   In the Logos System, PROCESS Nouns are convertible to verbs and vice versa.  This supports the need for stylistic transformations in translation;  e.g., for removal of waste * > for removing waste.  

Typical Patterns for Transitive PROCESS Nouns (PN):  

  For/By/Upon PN Type:

    For PN of NP * > to V NP

    By PN of NP * > by V'ing NP

    Upon PN of NP * > on V'ing NP

    E.g., upon removal of waste = on removing waste

  Provide/Give/ PN Type:

    Provide/give an indication * > indicate

  Cause/Effect/Make/Conduct + PN Type:

    Conduct a review of X * > review X

    Make a change in X * > change X

    Effect a break  = break

    Causes loss of heat in tank * > cause tank to lose heat

    Cause heat loss in tank * > cause tank to lose heat

**Tips:**  In the Logos System lexicon, all verbs have two transfers:  (a) the target verb equivalent and (b) the target process noun derived from the verb.  Similarly, all process noun entries have two transfers:  (a) the target process noun equivalent and (b) the target verb derived from the process noun.  This circumstance was made necessary by the fact that some languages prefer the use of nominalized verbs in place of verbs themselves, and thus for translations to be stylistically correct, it could be necessary to transform a source verb into a target process noun and vice versa.

**Developers' Tips:**    Note that a process noun cannot be in the Logos lexicon both as transitive and intransitive.  If a verb can be both transitive and intransitive, the process noun derived from that verb, such as display or change, must be entered as one or the other, based on most likely usage. 

 

 

.. _measure-noun-superset: 

MEASURE Noun Superset  [mnemonic: ME]    [8]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:**    The MEASURE Noun Superset includes the following sets:

(1) abstract concepts measured by unit such as weight, slope, load, cycle.   Words in this set are normally complemented by a unit of measure, e.g., weight of eight pounds, cycle of four seconds.

(2) discrete measurable concepts such as quantity, amount, valence, increment, count.  Words in this set occur in constructions like quantity of six, a count of twelve, a multiple of five, typically without a unit of measure specified.

(3) units of measure such as pound, gallon, watt, minute, dollar, inch.  Units of measure typically complement the abstract concept measured by unit, such as a period of three years, a sum of four dollars. 

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

abstract concepts measured by unit [mnemonic: MEabs]     [8 46]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Concepts that are measured by units of measurement. 

**Examples:**   absolute value, boiling point, bulk, capacity, dividend, duration, freezing point, grace period, humidity, intensity, interest, latitude, overtime, sabbatical, temperature, vacation, velocity, voltage, weight, workday

**Tips:**   Nouns coded in this set are usually expressed in a syntactic pattern as follows:

abstract concepts measured by unit + number + standard unit of measure

    a weight of two pounds; 

    a distance of seven miles; 

    a humidity of fifty percent; 

    a speed of seventy-five miles per hour.           

**Caution:**   Some concepts which are measurable may also have a verbal sense such as resistance, pressure, charge-back.  In such cases, these words should be more properly placed under the strong verbal subset in the ABSTRACT Superset.  This is important so that such words can be coded for their governance; e.g., resistance to, pressure on, etc.                

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

discrete measurable concepts [mnemonic: MEdis]    [8 95]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    A narrow set of measurable terms that can usually be followed by the preposition of and a discrete number without a unit of measure.

**Examples:**    addend, amount, count, increment, limit, majority, mean, multiple, multiplier, percentage, quantity, quorum, quotient, ratio, square root, subtrahend, valence

**Tips:**   Nouns coded in this set are usually expressed in a syntactic pattern as follows:

     discrete measurable concept + number

    an increment of ten

    a factor of five

    a multiple of two

units of measure [mnemonic: ME]    [8 61]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Units of measure includes words such as year, dollar, pound, gallon, watt, minute, inch, etc.  Units of measure typically complement the abstract concepts measured by unit, such as a period of three years, a sum of four dollars. 

Subsets within the units of measure set are:

* units of weight

Words like hundreds, thousands should be coded under numerics in the ASPECTIVE Superset.

Words like cube and sphere should be coded as configurations in the ASPECTIVE Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

units of temperature [mnemonic: MEtemp]    [8 61 164]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns denoting degrees of temperature in a body or an environment

**Examples:**   BTU, calorie, degrees Celsius, degrees Fahrenheit, eutectic

**Caution:**   Words like absolute zero, absolute unit, and degree should be coded as undifferentiated under units of measure.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

units of energy/force [mnemonic: MEener]    [8 61 165]

TIME Noun Superset  [mnemonic: TI]     [10]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:**    The TIME Noun Superset includes nouns which denote aspects of time, such as days of the week, periods of the day, etc.

**Examples:**    Monday, January, summer, evening, past, twilight, antiquity

The TIME Noun Superset includes the following subsets:

* periods of the day
* days of the week
* months of the year
* seasons of the year
* adverbial time nouns
* undifferentiated time

**Caution:**   Generic terms of time such as day, week, and person year are coded as units of duration under MEASURE Superset. 

Time events such as Christmas, payday, doomsday should be coded as time events under the ABSTRACT Superset.  Christmastime and Easter season, on the other hand, are proper TIME Nouns under seasons of the year.

The word date should be coded as symbolic data under the INFORMATION Superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

periods of the day [mnemonic: TIper]    [10 10 174]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Nouns designating periods of the day

**Examples:**   afternoon, bedtime, business hours, closing time, dawn, daybreak, dusk, eve, evening, lunchbreak, lunchtime, midnight, morning, office hour, PM, AM, rush hour, twilight

**Caution:**    Unlike lunchbreak, words like afternoon nap and coffee break are more a happening than a point of time during the day, and therefore are coded as a strong verbal under the ABSTRACT Superset.  This distinction may seem arbitrary, but the emphasis in the latter two is more on the action than the time, which is unspecific. 

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

days of the week [mnemonic:TIday]    [10 10 171]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    This refers to the proper names for the days of the week

**Examples:**    Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sabbath, (the) day after tomorrow, (the) day before yesterday

**Caution:**   Time events such as Christmas, payday, doomsday, three-day weekend should be coded as time events under the ABSTRACT Superset.

Yesterday, today, and tomorrow are coded as adverbs of time.  Note, however, that these words, when used in the possessive (yesterday's) do function as nouns.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

months of the year [mnemonic: TImon]    [10 10 172]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Proper names for the months of the year and their abbreviations

**Examples:**   January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December, Jan., Feb., etc.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

seasons of the year [mnemonic: TIsea]    [10 10 173]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Names for any seasons of the year, including natural times of the year

**Examples:**    Advent, autumn, Christmastime, Eastertide, equinox, Ides of March,   Lent, Mardi Gras, midsummer, Shrovetide, solstice, spring, springtime, summer,   winter

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

 

adverbial time nouns [mnemonic: TIadv]    [10 30 176]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   A highly restricted subset of adverbs which become nouns when used possessively. 

**Examples:**    today's, tomorrow's, tomorrow morning's, tonight's, yesterday's

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 

 

undifferentiated time [mnemonic: TIundif]    [10 30]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**   Designations for general undifferentiated periods of time

**Examples:**   Age of Enlightenment, antiquity, epoch, era, eternity, fiscal year, future, Jurassic Period, leap year, lifetime, past ages, peacetime, perpetuity, present age, spell, tax year, (the) Nineties, time, weekend

**Caution:**   The noun history is coded as a field of knowledge under the INFORMATION Superset.

Do not include here units of time, such as day, week, second, instant, microsecond, millennium, etc. These are units of duration under the MEASURE Superset.

A word like spell is a TIME noun whereas a word like period is a measurable concept. One can say a period of four days, but not a spell of four days; more typical is a spell of good weather.

Words like fiscal year and tax year should be coded here and not in the abstract concepts measured by unit set in the Measure Superset because it is unlikely that the word year would be followed by a unit of time.  That is, one wouldn't say "a tax year of one year."  However, if a word could be followed by a unit of time then it should be coded as an abstract concept measured by unit in the Measure Superset;   e.g., filing period (of 90 days);  billing period (of one month).

.. _aspective-noun-superset: 

ASPECTIVE Noun Superset  [mnemonic: AS]    [2]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:**    The ASPECTIVE Noun Superset includes words that are aspects of something else; for example,  piece, set or layer.   ASPECTIVE Nouns are easy to recognize because they invite a second noun to follow them, usually preceded by of in English.  For example, a piece of something;  a set of something;  a layer of something.

**Tips:**  The sense of an ASPECTIVE Noun is incomplete or unclear in the absence of a noun complement.  The thought can be completed by any number of noun complements, each one changing the meaning of the ASPECTIVE Noun, as is demonstrated below:

* a piece of ?          cake?  advice?  glass?   paper?
* the end of ?          the sentence?  an era?  the line?  a term?
* a segment of ?     the circle?  the population?  the track?  the wiring?
* a set of?               headphones?   numbers?  dishes?  pliers?
* a band of?           light?  gold?   soldiers?  musicians? 

When an ASPECTIVE Noun is a single word, code it according to its aspective code, as in the case of words like center or section.

When an ASPECTIVE Noun is compounded, as in phrases like shopping center or  residential section, code it by the code of its modifier.  A shopping center and a residential section are PLACE Nouns.

When the modifier of an ASPECTIVE Noun is weak in meaning, as in the case of phrases like turbulence center or center section, code the phrase as ASPECTIVE.  In each of these cases, the mind still craves completion of the thought: turbulence center of what?  center section of what? 

The ASPECTIVE Noun Superset contains the following sets:

* aspective bearing surfaces
* aspective functionals
* members/portions/parts
* aggregates
* numeric groupings
* aspective receptacles
* aspective thresholds/focal points/barriers/ limits
* model/copy
* configurations/order
* aspective conduits

**Developers' Tips:**    Constructions like three pieces of cake, when parsed, form an unusual NP where the morphology of the NP is taken from the aspective (in this case plural) and the semantics of the NP is taken from the second noun (cake).  The rule would be as follows

N [ASpart] [pl] + N [MAedib] [sg] * > NP [MAedib] [pl]

 

 

 

 

aspective bearing surfaces [mnemonic: ASsurf]    [2 21]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**    Aspects that relate to surfaces

**Examples:**   bottom, facet, ledge, plane, seat, sole, surface, top

**Tips:**   For the noun to be ASPECTIVE, it must invite the genitival complement of + NOUN.

When an ASPECTIVE Noun is a single word, code it according to its aspective code.
E.g., top = bearing surface under ASPECTIVE Superset.

When an aspective noun is compounded, code it by the code of its modifier.
E.g., counter top = bearing surface under CONCRETE Noun Superset.

When its modifier is weak in meaning, code the phrases as aspective. 
E.g., removable top = bearing surface under ASPECTIVE Superset.

UNKNOWN Words Superset  [mnemonic: UN]    [1]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:**  UNKNOWN words are words that were unfound in the dictionary at time of translation and labeled by the system as "unknown"   The three types of unknown words are shown below.

words w/ initial cap      
[mnemonic: UNinit]   [1 1 859]
If the word has an initial cap it will be assigned the code shown above. 

words in all caps       
[mnemonic: UNall]   [1 1 228]
If the word has all capital letters, it will be assigned the code shown above. 

alpha-numeric strings     
[mnemonic: UNalnum]  [1 1 989]
If the word is an alpha-numeric string, it will be assigned the code shown above.

**Tips:**  TermBuilder users have no need of this superset.

**Developers' Tips:**

 

 
.. _remote-agentive-subset:
 
remote agentive subset   [mnemonic: REagen]    [228]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**  This code may overlay the subset of any noun which is NOT already a member of some subset and which functions as a strong agentive,  e.g., business office. 

**Examples:**   academy, bank, college, office

**Tips:**  Business office is coded as a functional location.  Assigning a remote agentive subset gives a noun like business office an agentive quality that other functional locations, such as landing field, building site, or archiving workstation, do not require.

In general, remote agentives would be assigned mainly to functional locations under the PLACE Noun Superset.  ANIMATE Nouns are agentive by definition, as is the agentive set of CONCRETE Nouns.

**Caution:**  

**Developers' Tips:**   

 
.. _remote-mass-subset:
 
remote mass subset   [mnemonic: REmass]    [855]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**  This code may overlay the subset of any noun which is not coded a mass noun.  It signifies that a noun so coded may sometimes act like a MASS Noun.  Examples of this are words such as space or room.

**Examples:**  
    "They needed more room for . . ."

    "They did not have enough room . . ."

    "They had to make space . . ."

**Tips:**  It is important that words that can function without articles in the singular and can be preceded by some or more without becoming plural be given this code.  

This is true even if, in assigning this code, this action overlays another subset code;  MASS Noun codes are very high in the priority of coding importance (see below for exception for ABSTRACT Nouns).  The parser relies upon them heavily for resolving noun-verb homographs. 

**Caution:**   The remote mass subset need not be applied to the ABSTRACT Noun Superset.  This superset is considered to have a mass noun property by definition. 

**Developers' Tips:**    Many information-type nouns function as mass nouns and should, therefore, be given the remote mass subset code;  for example, words like  evidence, testimony, insurance and text.

E.g. 
    "This book has very little text, mostly illustrations."

    "The program edits text that comes from . . ."

 

 
.. _apposition-inviting-subset:
 
apposition-inviting subset   [mnemonic: APinvit]    [986]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Definition:**  This code may overlay the subset of any noun which is NOT already a member of some subset and which invites complementation.

**Examples:**   hurricane Andrew;  the letter Y;  the novel Gone with the Wind;   the opera Rigoletto;  the painter Matisse;  the poet Keats

**Tips:**   This code need not apply to nouns in the classifier set of the CONCRETE Superset.    (Eg., element, constellation, mineral)   These take complementation by definition. 

**Caution:**  Care should be exercised in assigning this subset code to nouns which already have subsets; e.g., the arts subset under the Information Noun Superset, because the original subset will be overlaid.  Judgment should be exercised as to which is the more critical code.  If the original subset code is apposition-inviting virtually by definition, then the apposition can be handled with a rule.  See "Developers' Tips" under the subset named "the arts."
