OpenLogos
---------

OpenLogos is an open source program that translates from English and German into French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. It accepts various document formats and maintains the format of the original document in translation. OpenLogos does not claim to replace human translators; rather, it aims to enhance the human translator's work environment.

The OpenLogos program is based on the Logos Machine Translation System, one of the earliest commercial machine translation programs. The original program was developed by Logos Corporation in the United States, with additional development teams in Germany and Italy. 

History
---------

Logos Corporation was founded by Bernard (Bud) Scott in 1970, who worked on its Logos Machine Translation System until the company's dissolution in 2000. The project began as an English-Vietnamese translation system, which became operational in 1972 (during the American-Vietnam War), and later was developed as a multi-target translation solution, with English and German as source languages. 
The Logos system is currently owned by `Group Business Software AG <http://www.group.de/en/index.php>`_, who also offer commercial licenses.
After Group AG made the decision to open source the code in 2005, the Language Technology Lab at `German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) <https://www.dfki.de/en/web>`_ created `OpenLogos <https://sourceforge.net/projects/openlogos-mt/>`_, a Linux-compatible version of the original Logos program released under the GNU GPL license.

Languages
---------
Currently, OpenLogos translates from German and English into French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. In the long term, the goal of OpenLogos developers is to support bidirectional translation among these languages.
