Getting Started with SAL
========================

This tutorial is designed to assist users of TermBuilder who want to learn more about the SAL coding of new dictionary entries. 

Users can avail themselves of this tutorial via hyperlinks in TermBuilder.  These links take you to relevant explanations of SAL coding terms and elements. 

Alternatively, this tutorial may serve as a stand-alone introduction to the SAL representation language of the Logos System.  The tutorial also contains links to SAL-related information useful to developers and advanced users.

Users of TermBuilder are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the SAL Representation Language.  Although TermBuilder can automatically encode new entries via the AutoCode function, such codes are not as accurate as codes assigned by tutored users.

Accurate codes provide the system with the intelligence necessary for good translation results.  Poor code assignments will degrade the system over time.
