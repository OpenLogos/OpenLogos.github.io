SAL Tutorial
========================================

This tutorial will get you up to speed with the Semantico-Syntactic Abstraction Language (SAL).

The SAL Representation Language is the internal language of the Logos System.

SAL enables the computer to process the sentences of your text both at the level of word meaning (semantics) and sentence structure (syntax).

When the Logos System processes the sentences of your text, it is actually processing a SAL representation of your text.

A SAL representation of your text begins when you enter the words of your text in TermBuilder.  SAL codes are assigned at that time through coding decisions made by you or by the AutoCode function.

Codes assigned by a tutored user tend to be more reliable than those assigned by the AutoCode function.

Translation quality will reflect the accuracy of your SAL code assignments. It is crucial then that you, as a TermBuilder user, have some understanding of SAL.
