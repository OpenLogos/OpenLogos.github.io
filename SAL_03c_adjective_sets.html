<h2>General Explanation of SAL Adjective Taxonomy<a class="headerlink" href="#general-explanation-of-sal-adjective-taxonomy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Adjectives are organized in a taxonomy of supersets, sets, and subsets.</p>
<p>Adjectives have three supersets:  descriptive, present-participial, and past-participial.</p>
<p>The descriptive superset includes a broad range of adjectives divided into the sets shown at left.  The sets are based on the syntactic relationships shared by its set members (e.g. adjectives that take clausal complements, etc.)</p>
<p>When coding an adjective, if the adjective can participate in more than one superset or set, it is important that the highest code be assigned according to the following priority:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>descriptive</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>pre-clausal</p></li>
<li><p>pre-verbal</p></li>
<li><p>adverbial*</p></li>
<li><p>non-adverbial</p></li>
<li><p>post-nominal</p></li>
<li><p>prefixes</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>present participial*</p></li>
<li><p>past participial*</p></li>
</ul>
<p>* participial adjectives are automatically coded by TermBuilder, based on their respective verbs</p>
</section>
<section id="descriptive-adjectives-superset">
<h2>Descriptive Adjectives Superset<a class="headerlink" href="#descriptive-adjectives-superset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Non-participial, Descriptive Adjectives are organized as a single Superset with seven  sets.  Most of these sets contain subsets.</p>
<p>As with most other parts of speech in SAL, adjectives are subclassified according to the syntactic relationships that they tend to have with other words.</p>
<p>The sets within the Descriptive Adjective Superset are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>pre-clausal adjectives [PC]. Adjectives like evident, apparent introduce “that” clauses (“It was evident that …”)</p></li>
<li><p>preverbal adjectives [PV]. Adjectives like eager, dangerous, ready, etc. introduce “infinitive” clauses (“They were eager to go.”).  Adjectives like instrumental, capable, etc. introduce other types of verbal clauses (“They were instrumental in solving …” -  “They were capable of solving …”)</p></li>
<li><p>adverbial adjectives [AV]. Adjectives like slight, real, minimal, etc. have adverbial counterparts (slightly, really, minimally).  This classification allows the system to transform phrases like rapid oscillation to oscillate rapidly, a transformation often called for in certain target languages.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The adverbial adjective set is further broken down into adjective subsets with adverbial coloration;  e.g., manner (intrepid); time (immediate); place (local); order (previous); degree (utter).</p>
<p>Adverbial adjectives may also be coded for governance of a particular preposition;  e.g. adjacent to, distant from, indifferent about.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>non-adverbial adjectives [NAV]  Adjectives in this set do NOT have adverbial counterparts and CANNOT be converted to adverbs (e.g. yellow)  The non-adverbial adjective set is distributed over two subsets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>predicate adjective:  adjectives which functions as a predicate adjective.They fit  the pattern: NP is ADJ.  (E.g., The flower is yellow.)</p></li>
<li><p>non-predicate adjective:  An adjective which functions only attributively.  (E.g., Atlantic, bridal, naval). They fit the pattern DET ADJ N</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Pure post-nominal [POST]: An adjective which can only occur in post-nominal position. (E.g., money galore).  There are only a few such adjectives in English.  These adjectives occur in the pattern NP ADJ, and usually stand for collapsed relative clauses.  E.g., The phrase The house ablaze with light can be parsed as a shortened form of The house that is ablaze with light… .  Note that these adjectives may be coded for prepositional governance, as in ablaze with.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefix:   Adjectives that appear exclusively in pre-nominal position.  E.g., anti-, pro-, omni-, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong>  Many adjectives fit in more than one category (e.g., lucky fits in most of the above categories).  In such cases, it is essential to choose the highest category according to the order of priority shown above.</p>
</section>
<section id="pre-clausal-adjectives">
<h2>Pre-Clausal Adjectives<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-clausal-adjectives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An adjective belongs in this set if it can be followed by a subordinate clause (E.g., It is mandatory that …; John was certain that… ).</p>
<p>Some adjectives in this set may also be pre-verbal if they can be followed by a verbal complement.  (E.g., It is mandatory to V;  John is good at V’ing, etc. ).</p>
<p>There are three subgroupings of pre-clausal adjectives, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pure logical: (It is ADJ that/to)</p>
<p>These adjectives take the logical it as a subject.  (E.g., It is apparent that … or It is urgent that/to … )  Pure Logical subsets are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>urgent type (that/to)</p></li>
<li><p>clear type (that)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Mixed logical: (It/NP is ADJ that/to)</p>
<p>These adjectives take either a normal NP subject or the logical it.   (E.g., She is certain that/to … or It is certain that/to … ).  Mixed logical subsets are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>certain type (that/to)</p></li>
<li><p>good type (that/to)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Non-logical: (NP is ADJ that/to)</p>
<p>These adjectives take a normal NP subject, but cannot take the logical it.   (E.g., He is happy that/to … or She is hopeful that … ).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>happy type (that/to)</p></li>
<li><p>aware type (that)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>pre-clausal: urgent type [mnemonic: PCurgent]  [code: 13 86 432]<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-clausal-urgent-type-mnemonic-pcurgent-code-13-86-432" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>   Urgent-type adjectives, when used as predicate adjectives, have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>may take that clause complementation, but only with logical it subject</p></li>
<li><p>may also take infinitive verb clause complementation, but only with logical it subject  (e.g., It is essential that they go/(for them) to go).</p></li>
<li><p>generally takes the subjunctive (e.g., It is important that he go.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>  appropriate, absurd, better, best, bizarre, compulsory, convenient, crucial, essential, feasible, important, irrelevant, mandatory, natural, necessary, optional, possible, proper, ridiculous, typical, unfair, unusual, urgent</p>
<p><strong>Patterns:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="simple">
<dt>It is ADJ that …</dt><dd><p>It was urgent that food be rushed to the refugees.</p>
</dd>
<dt>It is ADJ to NP that …</dt><dd><p>It is essential to the democratic process that voters be informed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>It is ADJ to V.</dt><dd><p>It is crucial to meet the deadline.</p>
</dd>
<dt>It is ADJ for N to V.</dt><dd><p>It is feasible for the two companies to merge.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>  For some adjectives in this subset, the test for that clause complementation may be extended to include wh- clauses.  E.g., It is optional whether they do this or not.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong>   When in the predicate adjective position, PCurgent adjectives cannot take a normal NP subject and have that clause complementation ( e.g. *He is essential that…).</p>
<p>When in the predicate adjective position,  PCurgent adjectives that do have a normal NP subject (e.g. Vitamins are important) cannot simultaneously take infinitive clause complementation.  For example, in sentences (1) and (2) below, the infinitive clause is adverbial.  (In both (1) and (2), the particle to has the sense of in order to.)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>John’s contribution is essential to accomplish this task.</p></li>
<li><p>John is the best person to accomplish this task.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Developers’ Tips:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>It was important for the citizens of Boston that the team won.</p></li>
<li><p>The coach held aloft the Keys to the City of Boston that the team won.</p></li>
<li><p>It was important for the citizens of Boston to win this series.</p></li>
<li><p>The team needed the support of the citizens of Boston to win this  series.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In (1), the assignment of PCurgent to the adjective important allows a deterministic parser to interpret that the team won as a subordinate clausal complement to the adjective, and not as a relative clause as in (2).  This code also allows the parser to see the verb won as intransitive rather than transitive (as it is in (2)).</p>
<p>Similarly, in (3), the PCurgent code assigned to important enables a deterministic parser to interpret the infinitive clause to win this series as complementary to the adjective and not as adverbial to the sentence as in (4).  In (4), but not in (3), the particle to would be rendered in order to in the target language.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong>    Certain-type adjectives, when used as predicate adjectives, have the following characteristics:</p>

</dd>
<dt>NP is ADJ to VP …</dt><dd><p>The women’s team was certain to win.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>  For some adjectives in this subset, the test for that clause complementation may be extended to include wh- clauses.  E.g., It is not certain when/whether they will come.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong>   Note that some adjectives, like indisputable, undecided, uncertain, incurious, etc., which bear a partial resemblance to PCcertain type adjectives, nevertheless do not satisfy all the conditions of this subset and hence should not be so encoded.   E.g. *John is undecided to vote in the election.</p>
<p><strong>Developers’ Tips:</strong>  The PCcertain code allows a deterministic parser to distinguish between that clauses which complement the adjective and relative clauses, and between infinitive clauses which complement the adjective and adverbial clauses.

<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Note that this type of adjective, when used attributively (e.g., nice gesture) may still take its verbal complementation.  For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It was a great party to attend  (i.e. It was great to attend that party)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong>   Note that good-type adjectives do NOT take that clause complementation when used attributively. E.g., the that clause in It was a great game that we won is a relative clause, not an adjective complement.</p>
<p><strong>Developers’ Tips:</strong>  The PCgood code allows a deterministic parser to distinguish between that clauses which complement the adjective and relative clauses, and between infinitive clauses which complement the adjective  and adverbial clauses.

<h2>Pre-verbal Adjectives [PV]<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-verbal-adjectives-pv" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An adjective belongs to the pre-verbal set if, in the predicate adjective position, it can take verb clause complementation of one kind or another.</p>
<p>Note that pre-verbal adjectives DO NOT govern that clauses.</p>
<p>There are three subgroupings of pre-verbal adjectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pure logical: (It is ADJ to VP)
These adjectives may take the logical it as a subject when in the predicate adjective position.  (E.g., It is meaningless to VP. All such adjectives fall into a single Pure Logical subset:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>valid type (It is awkward to VP)</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Mixed logical: (It/NP is ADJ to VP)
These adjectives take both the logical it subject and a normal NP subject.  Mixed Logical subsets are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>easy type (It was easy to VP / NP is difficult to VP)</p></li>
<li><p>wise type (It is wise to VP / NP was rude to VP)</p></li>
<li><p>akin type (NP is akin to V’ing)</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Non-logical:  (NP is ADJ to VP)
These adjectives only take normal NP subjects. Non-Logical subsets are</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>eager type (NP is eager to VP)</p></li>
<li><p>first type (NP is next to VP)</p></li>
<li><p>busy type (NP is adverse to VP)</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When pre-verbal adjectives occur in the predicate adjective position, certain transformations are possible, depending on the subset type.  For example, in the valid subset, the adjective modifies the action rather than the agent, as in (1) below. This characteristic is also true of the easy and wise subsets.It is true in a more restricted sense in the case of the akin subset, as sentence (2), below, illustrates.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>It is <strong>awkward</strong> to say such things–&gt;Saying such things is <strong>awkward</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is <strong>akin</strong> to lying to do such things–&gt; Doing such things is <strong>akin</strong> to lying.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In all the remaining subsets, eager, first, and busy, the adjective modifies the agent rather than the activity, as illustrated in (3), below</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><p>John is <strong>eager</strong> to please–&gt; *Pleasing John is <strong>eager</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong>  A great many adjectives can take verbal complements when preceded by the intensifier too. (E.g., His hands were too cold to turn the knob.)  Unless such adjectives also take verbal complementation without the adverb too, they do NOT qualify as pre-verbals.</p>
<section id="pre-verbal-valid-type-mnemonic-pvvalid-code-13-83-418">
<h3>pre-verbal: valid type  [mnemonic: PVvalid]  [code: 13 83 418]<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-verbal-valid-type-mnemonic-pvvalid-code-13-83-418" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>    Valid-type adjectives, when used as predicate adjectives, have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>may have logical it for a subject when used with verbal complementation</p></li>
<li><p>takes various verb clause complementation (e.g., to V; for V’ing; for NP to VP)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>     arduous, awkward, bad, beneficial, common, counter-productive, fraudulent, healthy, impractical,   meaningless, pointless, profitable, tedious, treacherous, useful, valid, wholesome, worthwhile</p>
<p><strong>Patterns:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="simple">
<dt>It is ADJ to VP</dt><dd><p>It would be counter-productive to appeal the verdict.</p>
</dd>
<dt>It is ADJ for NP to VP</dt><dd><p>It would not be healthy for her to exercise.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong>   PVvalid adjectives cannot take that clause complementation.
PVvalid adjectives that have a normal NP subject (e.g. Jogging is wholesome) cannot simultaneously take infinitive clause complementation (See (1) below).</p>
<p><strong>Developers’ Tips:</strong>  In (1), below, the PVvalid code assigned to useful enables a deterministic parser to interpret the infinitive clause to build up one’s muscle tone as adverbial to the sentence.
In (1), therefore, the particle to would be rendered in order to in the target language.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Jogging is <strong>useful</strong> to build up one’s muscle tone.</p></li>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong>    Easy-type adjectives, when used as predicate adjectives, have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>may have logical it for a subject with verb clause complementation (E.g., It is pleasant to sail.)</p></li>
<li><p>may take a normal NP subject with verb clause complementation (E.g., Some people are hard to please.)</p></li>
<li><p>the pattern NP is ADJ to V e.g., (John is easy to please) transforms to: V’ing NP is ADJ where the ADJ modifies the V’ing and never the NP (e.g., Pleasing John is easy.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Adjectives preceded by a noun which becomes the direct object of the infinitive when the adjective is patterned as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>(NOUN) is easy TO (VERB) = It is easy TO (VERB) (NOUN).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Other examples are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Golf is difficult to master = It is difficult to master golf.
Sky diving is dangerous to attempt = It is dangerous to attempt sky diving.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>    calamitous, catastrophic, costly, dangerous, difficult, easy, hard,   hazardous, pleasant, safe, safer, simple, tough, unpleasant, unsafe</p>
<p><strong>Patterns:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="simple">
<dt>It is ADJ to VP</dt><dd><p>It is pleasant to sail.</p>
</dd>
<dt>It is ADJ to VP</dt><dd><p>It is easy to fix the pipe.</p>
</dd>
<dt>It is ADJ for N to VP</dt><dd><p>It is easy for a plumber to fix the pipe.</p>
</dd>
<dt>NP is ADJ to VP</dt><dd><p>The pipe is easy to fix.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>  In the case of the normal NP subject, easy-type adjectives always require the main verb of the VP (in the above patterns) to be transitive.  (See <strong>Developers’ Tips</strong>, below).</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Developers’ Tips:</strong>   In constructions like NP is ADJ to VP, if the ADJ is easy-type, the verb in VP must be resolved to the transitive, with the NP subject as its object. (E.g., John was <strong>easy</strong> to teach.)  Compare the case with other PV wise-, eager-, next-, and busy- types. (E.g., John was <strong>eager</strong> to teach.)</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong>  The ADJ in NP is ADJ to V  ( e.g., John was wise to leave) modifies the NP subject, unlike easy-type pre-verbal adjectives which modify the V complement.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong>    Valid-type adjectives, when used as predicate adjectives, have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>takes a normal NP subject</p></li>
<li><p>may take various types of verb clause complementation. (E.g., Mary was adept at handling such matters)</p></li>
<li><p>may NEVER have logical it for a subject</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>    adept, aggressive, allergic, assiduous, averse, busy, candid, capable, conscientious, deft, diligent, effective, forceful, handy, inept, proficient, resolute, resourceful, selective, thorough, unused, versatile</p>
<p><strong>Patterns:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="simple">
<dt>NP is ADJ V’ing.</dt><dd><p>He is busy answering phone calls.</p>
</dd>
<dt>NP is ADJ to V’ing</dt><dd><p>He is unused to speaking in public.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong>  In some of the patterns above ), the number of applicable adjectives may be as few as one (e.g. ADJ at V’ing: adept at V’ing).</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong>   The adjective close normally should be coded as busy-type adjectives (closer and closest are so encoded), but because close is ambiguous with respect to its part-of-speech,, it is coded as a noun/adjective homograph. (Click here for explanation)</p>
<p><strong>Developers’ Tips:</strong>   It is the responsibility of the rulewriter to insure that the noun/adjective homograph close is correctly resolved to a busy-type adjective.</p>

<h2>Adverbial Adjectives [AV]<a class="headerlink" href="#adverbial-adjectives-av" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>    Adverbial type adjectives are a broad adjectival class distinguished by the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>denotes adverbial concepts of manner, place, time, degree, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>always has an adverb counterpart.  Either it is interchangeable with the adverb, (e.g., back, above, lower) or it is convertible to an adverb (e.g., immense/ immensely, former/formerly, lower/ lower, utter/utterly.</p></li>
<li><p>may (but not in all cases) function as predicate adjective</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Types: There are seven subsets under the adverbial adjective set.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>prep governance type</p></li>
<li><p>state/manner type</p></li>
<li><p>time/order type</p></li>
<li><p>locative type</p></li>
<li><p>quantity/measure type</p></li>
<li><p>degree (intensifier) type</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>   adverbial adjectives provide the translation system with information pertaining to stylistic transformations that may be required by the target language.</p>
<p>For example, if an adverbial adjective is followed by a Process Noun (e.g., swift movement), the NP can be transformed stylistically in the target language as move swiftly.  Such transformations are made possible because the lexical entry for the adjective points to both a target adjectival transfer and a target adverbial transfer (called the alternate word class).  (These transfers are entered during the TermBuilder session.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, NP’s like inner movement are NOT thus transformable and its adjective code would tell the system not to attempt such a transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> In coding adverbial adjectives, be sure to consider prepositional governance.  If an adverbial adjective governs a preposition (as, e.g., adjacent to) this fact preempts any other consideration for this type of adjective. (For more on this, see <strong>Developers’ Tips</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Developers’ Tips:</strong>  Codes for preposition governance are often of critical importance to parsing decisions. For example, in (1), below, the adjective tall is a state/manner type adverbial adjective, which does not govern prepositions, whereas in (2), adjacent is a prep governance type adjective, coded as governing the preposition to.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>He built his garage <strong>tall</strong> to store his truck.</p></li>
<li><p>He built his garage <strong>adjacent to</strong> mine.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In (1), the particle to has the value of in order to (and store is properly seen as a verb). In (2), the governance code assigned to adjacent allows the parser to see to as a preposition (and mine as a pronoun). If adjacent has not been properly coded for governance here, very likely to mine would have been seen as an adverbial infinitive clause. The only intelligence the parser has to work with in order to properly analyze (2) is the prep governance code assigned to the adjective adjacent.</p>

<h2>Pure Post Nominals [mnemonic: POST]  [code: 4 81 417]<a class="headerlink" href="#pure-post-nominals-mnemonic-post-code-4-81-417" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>   An adjective which can <strong>only</strong> occur in post nominal position; i.e., NP ADJ.  (E.g., The lottery winner suddenly had <strong>money galore</strong>.)</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>    galore, ablaze, abloom, astir, fraught, replete, unacquainted, asleep, unafraid, alike, alone, unalike, unsuited, afire, aflame, aglow, awash, alive, indebted, resistant, aground, ajar, amiss, awake, awry, aground,</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>   Pure post nominals, like galore, are rare in English. More often, when these adjectives occur, they usually stand for collapsed relative clauses.  For example, the phrase The house ablaze with light can be parsed as a short form of The house that is ablaze with light… ..</p>
<p>Frequently, a pure post nominal may govern a particular preposition.  E.g., awash with, unsuited for, fraught with, indebted to.  In such cases, the adjective is coded to reflect the prepositional governance.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong>   An adjective should only be coded as a pure post-nominal if it can never be preposed, such as galore, ablaze or alike.  Adjectives which may occasionally function as postposed, but which are normally preposed, should not be coded as post- nominal; e.g., green in the following example: She flashed eyes green with envy.  The reason for this is made clear in the following examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>He painted a house with shutters galore.</p></li>
<li><p>He painted the house with shutters green.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In (1), if galore is correctly coded as pure post nominal, the parser would see it correctly as an adjective modifying shutters.  However, in (2), if green were incorrectly coded as pure post nominal, the parser would be unable to see green as a predicate complement and would therefore parse it incorrectly.</p>
<p><strong>Developers’ Tips:</strong>    On the basis of the numeric codes, pure post nominal adjectives constitute a subset under the non-adverbial adjective set . For purposes of taxonomic clarity, however, it is being treated in the tutorial as a separate set.  There are no hidden implications in this change.</p>

<h2>Participial Adjectives Superset<a class="headerlink" href="#participial-adjectives-superset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Present Participle [mnemonic: PRES] [code: 15] [form: 60]
Past Participial [mnemonic: PAST] [code: 16] [form: 50]
-ABLE Participles [mnemonic: ABLE] [code 16] [form: 23]</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>   An adjective belongs in this category if it is a participial form of a verb in current usage. Participles are of three kinds:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>present participle (e.g., hoping, designing, realizing)</p></li>
<li><p>past participle (e.g., seen, revised, displayed)</p></li>
<li><p>-ABLE participle   (e.g. consignable, obtainable, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Participial adjectives derive their coding automatically from their respective verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Participial adjectives may also function as attributive descriptive adjectives, as in a telling glance, the known world, adjustable amount.  However, it is the participial function that determines their classification (e.g., the reporter covering this meeting, or the reporter assigned to cover this meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong>  A fair number of present participles are used only attributively and in effect lose their verbal coloration.  Consider the following sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>This book is interesting, fascinating, riveting, pleasing, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The author’s reputation is growing.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In (1) the proper parse for is interesting, etc. is BE + PREDICATE ADJ. In (2) the parse for is growing would be V(PRES PROGRESSIVE TENSE).  The verbal -ING form in (2) can always be modified by an adverb (…is growing slowly).  This is never the case in (1), indicating that it is no longer verbal in function. (The adjectival -ING form of course can be modified by intensifier adverbs like very, exceedingly, etc.)</p>
<p>Much the same can be said of certain -ABLE participles. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>This kitten is adorable.</p></li>
<li><p>This book is obtainable from the author.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In (1) the proper parse for is adorable is BE + PREDICATE ADJ.  In (2) the parse would see obtainable as the main verb.</p>
<p>All adjectival -ING and -ABLE forms are stored in the lexicon as participles. Parsing rules that draw upon the the Semantic Table are responsible for recognizing when an -ING form or -ABLE form is functioning purely attributively. In such cases, the Semantic Table will change the target language transfer supplied by the lexicon, where necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Developers’ Tips:</strong>  Note that the only numeric coding distinction between past participles and -ABLE participles is the form codes of 60 and 23, respectively.</p>
